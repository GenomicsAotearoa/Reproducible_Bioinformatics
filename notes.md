- computer == calculator, even stochastic programs can have the random seeds saved
- will it run? did it get mangled during copy and paste? did you have to make some changes to the code to get it to run?

- , *e.g.* on your workstation or under `$HOME` on shared hardware
- , e.g. on a compute cluster
 or copy and paste them from a text file

- how users (not computer scientiests) can use a software stack to make their research reproducible

- convenience of WF managers (reuse the same code for all data)

- check academic twitter for complaints about conda

- workflow managers allow you to run singularity transparently
