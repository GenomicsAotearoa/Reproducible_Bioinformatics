# Reproducible Bioinformatics

- The need to reproduce results both internally and by others, and sharing of complex computational analysis workflows, is a requirement for good scientific practice [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285">1</a>,<a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/2153-3539.197197">2</a>]
- This project aims to put together some useful information, tutorial and links that can be used to get started with reproducible research. This is being put together by team members from <a href="https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/bioinformatics-capability">Genomics Aotearoa</a> (Joseph Guhlin, Tom Harrop and Ngoni Faya), <a href="https://www.nesi.org.nz/">NeSI</a> (Dinindu Senanayake and Megan Guidry) and <a href="https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/">Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research</a> (Aleksandra Pawlik).
